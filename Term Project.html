<p>During the lab session this week you will start organizing yourself for the term project. Read a document in <em>Learning-Hub</em> named <em>COMP3717_202030_TermProject.docx</em> under <em>Content</em> &gt;&gt; <em>Projects.</em></p>
<p>Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize yourself in teams of 2-3 individuals</li>
<li>Decide on an idea</li>
<li>Decide on a preliminary team name</li>
</ul>
<p>If necessary, ask your lab instructor to setup a breakout room for your team so that you can discuss among yourselves. Otherwise, you can use any other tool like Slack, Discourse, Teams, etc...</p>
